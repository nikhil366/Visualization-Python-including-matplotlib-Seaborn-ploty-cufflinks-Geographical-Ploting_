Data Visualization in Python - Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. The term is often used interchangeably with others, including information graphics, information visualization and statistical graphics.

Data visualization is important for almost every career. It can be used by teachers to display student test results, by computer scientists exploring advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) or by executives looking to share information with stakeholders. It also plays an important role in big data projects. As businesses accumulated massive collections of data during the early years of the big data trend, they needed a way to quickly and easily get an overview of their data. Visualization tools were a natural fit.

Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features. No matter if you want to create interactive, live or highly customized plots python has an excellent library for you.

To get a little overview here are a few popular plotting libraries of  Python that we are going to use and understand in this Repo:

Matplotlib: low level, provides lots of freedom

Pandas Visualization: easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib

Seaborn: high-level interface, great default styles

Plotly: can create interactive plots

Cufflinks

Geographical Plotting

Basically this all are type of library which we are going to use in this repository for data visualization and after understanding core concepts of all libraries we can move to do few capstone projects to understand data visualization in real time.

So moving forward to understand how many types of chart are available and how many we are going to use:
1. Bar chart
2. Line Chart
3. Scatter plot
4. Box plot
5. Histogram
6. Area chart
7. Bubble chart
8. Density curve
9. Violin plot
10. Heatmap
11. Pie chart
12. Column Chart
13. Spread Chart
14. surface Chart
15. Chropleth (for Maps)
